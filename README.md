### Community & Volunteering 🩵

Despite being away from github and without public projects (I intend to change this reality), I participated in many events as a participant, organizer or contributing in some way, mainly with a focus on networking, developing myself and encouraging more women to enter the technology field.
I was an organizer and volunteer teacher for 3 years at js4Girls Floripa (face-to-face workshops), training around 300 women in CSS, HTML and programming logic with JS.
